# Local Tree Model Interface

Run the backend and try the interface locally.

## Setup

Run the startup script (requires Python 3.11):

   - **Linux**: `./run.sh`
   - **Windows**: `./run.bat` (untested, AI generated based on run.sh)

This creates a virtual environment of Python 3.11 (if needed), installs requirements.txt, and starts the backend server using:  

    python backend/backend.py

*(First run will take a couple of minutes.)*

## Try the Interface

Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser.  
Use the buttons to send API calls and interact with the model.
